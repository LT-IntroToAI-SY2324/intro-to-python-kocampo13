# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
Python is a bit different from Java but I thought that they were going to be completely diferenta nd more difficult to understand. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
There are some similarites but the syntax is a lot easier to understand in Python than in Java. Indentation is very important in Python since there are no brackets required like it is in Java. A similarity is that loops are almost the same but there are no () or ; in Python.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned that python is different from Java but there are still similarities that help understand each language.
